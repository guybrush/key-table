# key-table

a key-table for browsers

maybe `[` is better than `openbracket`? but then how would we treat `numlock`?

I did not publish to npm yet, since I think `key-table` is a pretty nice name
and shouldnt wasted with a not-yet-finished thing?

also this should use ci.testling.com when i get some free time, or maybe
write another module which uses the ci
